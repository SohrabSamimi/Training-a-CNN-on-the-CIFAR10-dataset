# Training-a-CNN-on-the-CIFAR10-dataset

This repository is strongly inspired by the Pytorch tutorial called "Training a Classifier" at the following link:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html

I first understood the code, and then wrote the code myself to train the CNN on CIFAR-10.
I also changed several hyperparameters.
