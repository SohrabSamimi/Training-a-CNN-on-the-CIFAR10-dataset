# Training-a-CNN-on-the-CIFAR10-dataset

CIFAR10 is a dataset containing 60000 images in 10 classes(plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
The goal is to train a CNN so that given a new image not seen before, the network will be able to tell you which class 
the image belongs to amongst the 10 classes above.

This repository is strongly inspired by the Pytorch tutorial called "Training a Classifier" at the following link:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html
           
I first understood the code from the tutorial, and then rewrote the code myself to train the CNN on CIFAR-10.
I also changed several hyperparameters from the Pytorch tutorial.
